            <h2>India’s World Cup Triumphs</h2>
            <h3>1983 Cricket World Cup</h3>
            <p>India's first World Cup victory in 1983 stands as one of the most celebrated moments in cricket history. Under the leadership of Kapil Dev, the team defied expectations by defeating the mighty West Indies in the final at Lord’s. The underdog Indian side, dismissed as unlikely contenders, stunned the cricketing world with grit and determination. Kapil Dev’s iconic 175* against Zimbabwe in a crucial group-stage match is still remembered as one of the finest innings in ODI history. In the final, India’s resolute bowling and fielding turned the tables on a dominant West Indies team, propelling Indian cricket into the global spotlight.</p>

            <h3>2007 ICC T20 World Cup</h3>
            <p>The inaugural ICC T20 World Cup in 2007 marked a groundbreaking moment for the shortest format of the game. Under the fearless leadership of MS Dhoni, India captured the imagination of fans with thrilling performances. The final against Pakistan was a nerve-wracking encounter that ended with India securing a five-run victory in the last over. Yuvraj Singh’s six sixes in an over against Stuart Broad became one of the most iconic moments in T20 cricket. This victory not only heralded India's dominance in T20s but also sparked a revolution in the game’s global popularity.</p>

This victory wasn’t just about reclaiming the ODI crown; it was a culmination of years of hard work and unity.</p>

            <h3>2013 ICC Champions Trophy</h3>
            <p>Although it wasn’t a World Cup, the 2013 Champions Trophy victory further demonstrated India’s dominance in limited-overs cricket. Rain played a significant role in the final against England, reducing it to a 20-over contest. Despite the challenges, India emerged victorious thanks to stellar performances by Ravindra Jadeja and the bowling unit. This triumph highlighted India’s adaptability in high-pressure scenarios and capped off an era of white-ball cricket success.</p>

            <h3>2024 ICC T20I World Cup</h3>
            <p>India's triumph in the 2024 T20I World Cup reaffirmed its status as a global cricketing superpower. Held in the Caribbean and the United States, this tournament showcased India’s adaptability and versatility in varying conditions. The team’s batting depth, sharp bowling, and exceptional fielding were on full display throughout the competition.
